    <p>Magwinya is a South African comfort food. All it is, is a ball of dough fried in a bunch of oil</p>
    
    
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons instant yeast</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil (plus more for frying)</li>
            <li>2 cups warm water</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the dry ingredients: flour, sugar, yeast, and salt. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Add the water and 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil and mix into a soft dough</li>
            <li>Cover the mixture with a tea towel and allow to rise for about one hour. The dough should roughly double in size.</li>
            <li>Mix further and let the dough rest for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat a large pot of vegetable oil over a medium flame for deep frying. Test the temperature of the oil by dropping a little batter in. If it sizzles, youâ€™re ready to start frying</li>
            <li>With a tablespoon, add dollops of dough into the oil, using a second spoon to help push the dough down if necessary. Make sure you turn them frequently until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Drain over paper towels and serve whilst they are warm.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Enjoy!</h3>
